## 🎯 Today's Goal

Implement AI intent detection, natural conversation flow, and patient information collection per the monthly plan Week 2 (Jan 17–23). This includes: OpenAI integration for intent classification, conversation state management and response generation, and PHI-compliant patient data collection with consent.

## ✅ Today's Deliverables

By end of day, you should have:

- [x] OpenAI API client configured (config/env already has OPENAI_API_KEY)
- [x] Intent types defined: book_appointment, ask_question, check_availability, greeting, cancel_appointment, revoke_consent, unknown
- [x] Intent detection service with retry, caching, fallback, PHI redaction, and audit metadata
- [x] Conversation state management and response generation service
- [x] Multi-turn conversation support with history stored in database
- [x] Patient info collection flow (name, phone, DOB, gender, reason for visit) with Zod validation
- [x] Consent collection before PHI, consent storage (timestamp, status), and revocation flow
- [x] All AI interactions audited (metadata only; no raw prompts/responses with PHI)
- [x] Intent detection and conversation flows tested; compliance checks verified
