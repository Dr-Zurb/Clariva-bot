## 📝 Notes

- Tasks are moved here when they cannot be completed due to missing dependencies
- Each pending task file should reference the original task file
- Tasks should be moved back to the main task file once prerequisites are met
- File naming convention: `pending-{task-name}-{date}.md`
- Consider creating a tracking system for pending tasks across the project

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **When to move a task here:**
   - Task requires prerequisites that don't exist yet
   - Task is blocked by external dependencies
   - Task needs to be deferred to a later date

2. **When to move a task back:**
   - Prerequisites are now available
   - Dependencies are resolved
   - Ready to proceed with implementation

3. **File organization:**
   - Group by date or feature area if needed
   - Keep references to original task files
   - Update original task file to reference pending location
