## 📋 Documentation Reference Integration

**All development must follow our reference documentation:**

### 📚 Documentation Files (in `docs/Reference/`)

1. **[STANDARDS.md](../../Reference/STANDARDS.md)** - Rules and requirements
   - Use for: Coding rules, error handling, validation, authentication, logging
   - Key sections: Input Validation, Error Handling, Services Architecture, Webhook Security

2. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](../../Reference/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Project structure
   - Use for: Understanding folder structure, where to put code, layer boundaries
   - Key sections: Project Structure, Layer Boundaries, Request Flow

3. **[RECIPES.md](../../Reference/RECIPES.md)** - Copy-pastable patterns
   - Use for: Implementation templates, code examples, step-by-step guides
   - Key sections: Add Route, Add Controller, Add Service, Add Validation, Add Webhook

   - Use for: Data handling, security requirements, audit logging, access control, AI governance
   - Key sections: Data Classification, Audit Logging, Access Control, AI Safety, Security Baseline

### 🏗️ Architecture Patterns (from ARCHITECTURE.md & STANDARDS.md)
- ✅ **Controller Pattern** - All routes use controllers (routes define paths, controllers handle requests)
- ✅ **Router Pattern** - Routes organized in separate files, aggregated in `routes/index.ts`
- ✅ **Separation of Concerns** - Routes → Controllers → Services → Database
- ✅ **asyncHandler** - Use asyncHandler wrapper (not manual try/catch) - see STANDARDS.md
- ✅ **TypeScript Types** - All functions properly typed
- ✅ **Error Handling** - All errors extend AppError, use error middleware - see STANDARDS.md

### 🏥 Healthcare Compliance (from COMPLIANCE.md & STANDARDS.md)
- ✅ **Data Classification** - Public social data, administrative data, PHI (see COMPLIANCE.md section B)
- ✅ **Patient Data Encryption** - At rest and in transit (see COMPLIANCE.md section H)
- ✅ **No PII in Logs** - Only IDs, never patient names/phones (standard log fields required - see STANDARDS.md & COMPLIANCE.md section D)
- ✅ **Audit Logging** - Track all data access with correlationId (see COMPLIANCE.md section D)
- ✅ **Access Controls** - Doctor-only access to their patients via RLS (see COMPLIANCE.md section E)
- ✅ **Consent & Transparency** - Patient consent required for PHI collection (see COMPLIANCE.md section C)
- ✅ **Data Lifecycle** - Retention and deletion policies (see COMPLIANCE.md section F)

### 🤖 AI/ML Standards (from STANDARDS.md & COMPLIANCE.md)
- ✅ **Retry Logic** - Exponential backoff for AI API calls
- ✅ **Response Caching** - Cache common AI responses
- ✅ **Fallback Mechanisms** - Graceful degradation if AI fails
- ✅ **Response Validation** - Ensure appropriate medical responses
- ✅ **Rate Limiting** - Prevent API abuse
- ✅ **AI Safety & Governance** - AI is assistive only, no autonomous diagnosis (see COMPLIANCE.md section G)
- ✅ **PHI Redaction** - Redact PHI from prompts sent to external AI services (see COMPLIANCE.md section G)
- ✅ **AI Audit Logging** - Log all AI interactions (metadata only, no raw prompts/responses with PHI) - see COMPLIANCE.md section G

### 🔒 Webhook Security (from STANDARDS.md & RECIPES.md)
- ✅ **Signature Verification** - Verify all webhook signatures (see RECIPES.md section 5)
- ✅ **Idempotency** - Handle duplicate webhooks
- ✅ **Async Processing** - Don't block webhook responses
- ✅ **Retry Queues** - Retry failed webhook processing

### 💡 Quick Reference
- **"What are the rules?"** → Check [STANDARDS.md](../../Reference/STANDARDS.md)
- **"Where does code go?"** → Check [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../Reference/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **"How do I implement this?"** → Check [RECIPES.md](../../Reference/RECIPES.md)

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Instagram API changes:** Monitor Facebook Developer updates, have fallback plan
- **Payment gateway issues:** Test thoroughly, have support contact ready
- **AI accuracy:** Start with simple intents, iterate based on feedback
- **Reference documentation compliance:** Review code against [STANDARDS.md](../../Reference/STANDARDS.md), [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../Reference/ARCHITECTURE.md), [RECIPES.md](../../Reference/RECIPES.md), and [COMPLIANCE.md](../../Reference/COMPLIANCE.md) before each commit

### Timeline Risks
- **Feature scope creep:** Stick to MVP features only
- **Unforeseen technical issues:** Build in buffer time (extra 2-3 days)
- **Third-party service delays:** Start account setup early
- **Reference documentation learning curve:** Allocate time to understand [STANDARDS.md](../../Reference/STANDARDS.md), [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../Reference/ARCHITECTURE.md), and [RECIPES.md](../../Reference/RECIPES.md) patterns
